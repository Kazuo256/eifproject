I. Description:

    Experimental Isometric Framework (EIF) is a game framework project using the
  LÖVE2D game engine. Its purpose is to offer a light-weight but powerful
  alternative to both 3D engines and 2D sprite-based implementations of
  isometric game experience. It does use an intrinsically 2D only rendering
  system (that of LÖVE2D), but through the use and abuse of fragment shaders it
  is intended to surpass the boundaries of the 2D realm, at least graphically.

II. History:

    As of now, the project is still in its initial, draft-like stages. Nothing
  really significant has been done, and there are no official release yet.
